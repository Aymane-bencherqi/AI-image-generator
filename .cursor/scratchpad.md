# Background and Motivation
The goal is to build an AI-powered image generation tool where users can input a prompt describing a first-person POV scene (e.g., as Batman in Gotham), and the system generates cinematic, immersive images matching the description. The images should have a dramatic, atmospheric, and action-oriented style, similar to the provided examples, with the user as the main character.

# Key Challenges and Analysis
- Ensuring generated images consistently use a first-person POV.
- Achieving cinematic, high-quality, and contextually accurate visuals.
- Translating detailed, action-packed prompts into coherent images.
- Selecting or integrating an AI model capable of this style (e.g., Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, etc.).
- Handling user input, prompt engineering, and safety/content filtering.
- Providing a user-friendly interface for prompt submission and image display.

# High-level Task Breakdown
- [ ] Research and select an AI image generation model that supports first-person POV and cinematic styles.
- [ ] Design prompt engineering strategies to maximize first-person POV output.
- [ ] Build a backend service to handle prompt submission and image generation requests.
- [ ] Create a frontend UI for users to enter prompts and view generated images.
- [ ] Integrate the AI model with the backend and connect to the frontend.
- [ ] Implement safety checks and content filtering for user prompts and outputs.
- [ ] Test the system with various prompts to ensure quality and consistency.

# Project Status Board
